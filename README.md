## Strange Attractors

This repository contains browser-based visualizations for various strange attractors and chaotic dynamical systems.

## Overview

Strange attractors are sets of numerical values toward which a system tends to evolve, representing a chaotic state. This repository provides self-contained HTML files that simulate and visualize these mathematical structures directly in your web browser.

## Visualizations Included

This repository currently includes the following attractors:

- **Lorenz Attractor** (`lorenz.html`)
- **Thomas Attractor** (`thomas.html`)
- **Four-Wing Attractor** (`four_wing.html`)

## How to Use

No installation or build process is required. To run the visualizations:

1.  Download or clone this repository.
2.  Navigate to the directory containing the HTML files.
3.  Double-click any of the HTML files (e.g., `lorenz.html`) to open them in your default web browser.

> **Note:** These visualizations are designed to run in modern web browsers that support HTML5 Canvas.
